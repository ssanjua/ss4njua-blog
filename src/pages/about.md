# About Me

Hello! I'm Paula, a **Full Stack Developer** who is passionate about cybersecurity. In my free time, I'm learning about this fascinating field and solving machines on various platforms. You can check out my projects on my [portfolio](https://ssanjua.vercel.app) and follow my journey on [Linktree](https://ss-link.vercel.app/) and also my Portfolio terminal [portfolio](https://ssanjuaterminal.vercel.app).

I firmly believe that all IT professionals should learn more about cybersecurity. The **Introduction to Hacking** course from Hack4u opened my eyes and is helping me think about web development securely.

If youâ€™d like to get in touch, feel free to contact me via email or through my social media:
